Files here make use of ASM11, a freeware HC11 assembler for windows.  This assembler is an exe file,
but has been observed to run on WIN11 or earlier.  It can be obtained at: http://www.aspisys.com/asm11.htm
The "make files" (.bat and .pl files) depend on the ASM11.exe program being in the next highest directory.
If Placed elsewhere, the bat files or system path must be modified (the system path approach is dated, so
it may not work on hogher WIN OS implementations).

The make system also depends on having a perl script interpreter in the system.  See https://www.perl.org/
to obtian the system software needed to run the perl scripts.

Build instructions are generally found in an appropriatly named text file within the source subdirectory.
