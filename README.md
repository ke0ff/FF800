# FF800
FF-800 FTP file area.

Now includes source files with basic instructions for creating a build system for the HC11 Source code that is at the heart of most of the FF-800 products.
Note that these source files have minimal commmentary at this time, and would require considerable study before attempting to make changes.  Caveat emptor.
