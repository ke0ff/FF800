Porting the Crossbow code to ASM11: <DRAFT>

1) Rename all of the source files to be spaceless and to have a ".a" file extension
2) Produce a batch file that invokes fr.pl for each ".a" file in the build
3) run the above batch file.  The result is a *nearly* ASM11 ready.  Any #IF conditionals that
	used the "~" to signify "NOT" will need to be edited.  The #IF parameter needs to be
	enclosed in "{}" braces, and would be tested for equality to "FALSE" to replicate the
	Crossbow syntax.
   Further, all #IFs need to be examined to repair and double "=" expressions.

4) The result is a list of the original files, all with ".asm" extensions ready for assembly by ASM11.
5) Produce a maker batch file to simplify the assembly invocation.

Example maker batch file:
==============================================================================
rem This is the "maker" file for the FF-8070 assembly object.
rem		It assembles then builds the composite object file
rem

"C:\Users\ke0ff\Documents\FF-800\FF-800 SW-n-Manuals\V311 sw\asm11" -exp+ -c+ -e+ -rel- z8070.asm
@echo off
echo Press any key to exit . . .
pause>nul
===============================================================================

The path to the ASM11 folder needs to be pasted to get it to work easily.  This will be machine dependent unless
steps are taken to place ASM11.exe into a standard folder (not a bad idea, if I do say-so myself).

Most Crossbow projects have a single root source which includes all the other sources.  These projects only need
the above batch file to assemble and will produce a single object file.  The primary exception is the FF-800 source,
it requires several instantiations to produce all of the object files for the final build.  "ss.pl" is used to
stitch all of the objects into a single object result.  This schema can be adapted for other multi-compile builds
(tho none exist at this writing).

Multi-file assembly batch
===============================================================================
rem This is the "maker" file for the FF-800 assembly object.
rem		It assembles then builds the composite object file
rem		that can be downloaded to the FF-800 FFLASH system.
rem
rem	WORD3 changes must be assembled separately (and first) as
rem		this batch system depends on the WORD3 object being present
rem		and ready for combination.
